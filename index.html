        Okay /x/, I need your help with this. This is <em>not</em> a copypasta; it's a long read, but I feel like my safety or wellbeing could <strong>very well depend on this.</strong>
        It's video game related, specifically <i>Majora's Mask,</i> and is the <strong>creepiest</strong> shit that has <em>ever</em> happened to me in my entire life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, I recently moved into my dorm room starting as a Sophomore in college, and a friend of mine gave me his old Nintendo 64.
        I was <em>stoked,</em> to say the least - I could finally play all of those old games of my youth that I hadn't touched in at least a decade.
        His Nintendo 64 came with one yellow controller and a rather shoddy copy of Super Smash Brothers.
      </p>
      <p>
        While beggars can't be choosers, needless to say, it didn't take long until I became bored of beating up LVL 9 CPUs. That weekend, I decided to drive around a few neighborhoods about
        twenty minutes or so off campus, hitting up the local garage sales, hoping to score on some good deals from ignorant parents. I ended up picking up
        a copy of Pokemon Stadium, Goldeneye <i>(fuck yeah),</i> F-Zero, and two other controllers for two dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Satisfied, I began to drive out of the neighborhood when one last house caught my attention. I still have no idea why it did; there were no cars
        there and only one table was set up with random junk on it, but something sort of drew me there. I usually trust my gut on these things,
        so I got out of the car and was greeted by an <strong>old man.</strong> His outward appearance was, for lack of a better word, displeasing.
      <div class="sticky">
        <img src="assets/Ben Drowned Transparent.png" alt="Ben Drowned" class="ben" width="78.4" height="138.6" />
      </div>
        It was <strong>odd</strong> - if you asked me to tell you why I thought that, I couldn't really pinpoint anything. There was just something about him that put me on edge.
        I can't explain it. All I can tell you is that if it wasn't in the middle of the afternoon and there were other people within shouting distance, I would not have even thought of approaching this man.
      </p>
      <p>
        He flashed a <strong>crooked smile</strong> at me and asked what I was looking for. Immediately, I noticed that he must have been blind in one of his eyes;
        his right one had that "glazed over" look about it. I forced myself to look to his left eye instead, trying not to offend, and asked him if he had any old video games.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was already wondering how I could politely excuse myself from the situation when he told me he had no idea what a video game was.
        But to my surprise, he then said he had a few ones in an old box. He assured me he'd be back in a "jiffy" and turned to head back into the garage.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I watched him hobble away, I couldn't help but notice what he was selling on his table. Littered across it were ratherâ€¦ <strong>peculiar paintings;</strong>
        various artworks that looked like ink blots that a psychiatrist might show you. Curious, I looked through them - it was obvious why no one
        was visiting this guy's garage sale. These weren't exactly aesthetically pleasing. As I came to the last one, for some reason, it looked
        almost like <strong>Majora's Mask</strong> - the same heart-shaped body with little spikes protruding outward. Initially, I just thought that since I was
        secretly hoping to find that game at these garage sales, some Freudian bullshit was projecting itself into the ink blots, but given the events
        that happened afterward, I'm not so sure now. I should have asked the man about it. <em>I wish I did ask the man about it.</em>
